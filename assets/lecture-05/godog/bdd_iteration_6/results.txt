Feature: simple accumulator checks
  An accumulator must be able to add a number to its content

  Scenario Outline: Accumulate multiple values          # features/accumulator.feature:4
    Given I have an accumulator with 0                  # accumulator_test.go:11 -> iHaveAnAccumulatorWith
    When I add <amount> to accumulator                  # accumulator_test.go:16 -> iAddToAccumulator
    Then the accumulated result should be <accumulated> # accumulator_test.go:20 -> theAccumulatedResultShouldBe

    Examples:
      | amount | accumulated |
      | 0      | 0           |
      | 1      | 1           |
      | 1      | 2           |
        Incorrect accumulator value 1
      | 10     | 12          |
        Incorrect accumulator value 10
